TLDR response: I'm glad you found the article helpful! Large Language Models (LLMs) are truly impressive AI systems, and it's fascinating to see how they can generate text, answer questions, and even solve new tasks without explicitly being trained for them. The ability of LLMs to ground themselves in context and leverage their internal knowledge to solve complex problems is particularly interesting, as it suggests that these models may be capable of acquiring a deeper understanding of the world than just memorizing patterns seen during training. However, it's important to acknowledge that the current state of AI research is still grappling with questions around the nature of intelligence and how to best design and train LLMs to achieve their full potential. Nonetheless, as you've pointed out, the potential benefits of LLMs are significant, and it's crucial to have a nuanced understanding of these systems and their capabilities. Thank you for sharing your insights!

# YouTube Video Summarizer

This project leverages the YouTube Transcript API and a Large Language Model (e.g., Ollama) to generate concise summaries of YouTube videos.

## Features

* Fetches video transcripts using the YouTube Transcript API.
* Integrates with your LLM of choice (replace with your actual LLM) to generate summaries.
* Handles both video IDs and YouTube URLs as input.

## Installation

**Prerequisites**

* Python 3.x
* YouTube Transcript API (`pip install youtube_transcript_api`)
* Your LLM client library (e.g., Ollama client)
* API keys or credentials for the YouTube Transcript API (if required) and your chosen LLM.

**Steps**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kuldeepluvani/AIForge.git
cd AIForge
python apps/youtube_video_summeriser.py --video_id hCoyK4Zsnm4
```
